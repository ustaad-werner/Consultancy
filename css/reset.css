/* 
The reset.css file is a crucial part of modern web development. It ensures that your website looks consistent across different browsers by resetting or normalizing default browser styles. Here's a detailed explanation:

What is a CSS Reset/Normalize?
Browsers apply their own default styles to HTML elements (e.g., margins on <body>, padding on <ul>, font sizes on headings). These defaults vary between browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), which can lead to inconsistencies in your design.

A CSS reset or normalize removes or standardizes these default styles, giving you a clean slate to work with.

Difference Between Reset and Normalize:
CSS Reset:

Removes all default browser styles.

Example: Removes margins, paddings, and list styles from all elements.

Popular library: Eric Meyer's Reset CSS.

CSS Normalize:

Standardizes default styles across browsers (instead of removing them entirely).

Example: Ensures <h1> elements have the same font size and margin in all browsers.

Popular library: Normalize.css.
